    "# Exploring Why Civil Resistance Works\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will replicate some of the findings of a well-received book, [Why Civil Resistance Works](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/research/wcrw) by [Erical Chenoweth](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/) and Maria J. Stephan. The two authors examined whether nonviolent campaigns are more effective than violent campaigns. They found that yes; from a data set containing details of campaigns from 1900 onwards, they found that in general peaceful campaigns are more effective in achieving their aims than violent ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the following questions you will use the data that the authors helpfully provide at <https://www.ericachenoweth.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Data-and-Replication-Files-3.zip>. The data is in Stata format, which pandas can read without a problem. To understand the data, read the documentation at <https://www.ericachenoweth.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/WCRW-Appendix.pdf> (in particular, Table WA.7).\n",

You may seek help on the Internet, by Googling or searching in StackOverflow for general questions pertaining to the use of Python and pandas libraries and idioms.

You may discuss with your fellow students in order to better understand the questions, if they are not clear enough, but you should not ask them to share their answers with you, or to help you by giving specific advice."
